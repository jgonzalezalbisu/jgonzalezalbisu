<h1 align="center">Hi üëã, I'm Jorge</h1>
<h3 align="center">Software QA Engineer / IT Analyst</h3>


Experienced IT Analyst with 10+ years of proven expertise in Software Quality Engineering (SQE) with a diverse background in consulting across various industries including health, banking, treasury, travel, and e-learning. Adept at delivering high-quality results as both a functional and automation analyst, I possess a strong client-centric approach, prioritizing their business objectives and investing time in understanding their needs to provide valuable ideas and enhancements.

My technical proficiency extends beyond quality assurance, encompassing software development and a comprehensive understanding of QA automation tools, testing techniques, relational databases, and test automation processes. Notably, I have successfully utilized Java with Selenium and TypeScript with Cypress to create robust automation frameworks from scratch, delivering efficient front-end automation solutions with the primary objective of reducing the manual labor required by the team. With a proactive mindset, I continually assess the testing landscape, identify areas where automation can be leveraged effectively, and diligently work towards creating robust frameworks that streamline repetitive tasks and increase the scalability of testing processes.

With a track record of excellence in delivering tailored solutions and a commitment to driving client satisfaction, I am well-equipped to contribute to your organization's success in the IT industry.
